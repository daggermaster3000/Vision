# Vision
This code is part of the iGEM UniLausanne 2021 project. 
A very basic image processing script initially used to measure a ratio between two areas.
We are not programmers so the code is somewhat blasphematory.
The code to find the best thresholds is in the Hsvthreshold.py file.
The code for the image processing is in the Vision.py file.
The HSV thresholder we used to define the thresholds comes from the following thread

but any image editing software can be used.
